# Udacity-Project-Sentiment-Analysis-RNN

This project finalizes my Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree. This means that I have not written all the code by myself, but has filled in answers and code in the "TODO" sections.

The Project was about creating a simple RNN to predict sentiment in movie reviews. The project included 

1. Pre-proccesing of data
2. Training the model
3. Deploying an endpoint
4. Creating Lambda function, API in Amazon AWS to create a "real" web app using the deployed model.
